    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>This website based upon climate was created for the class Creative Technologies During Climate Crisis. The goal was to make web zines based on certain elements of climate crisis for each individual page. DIthering images was vital to the success of this project as one of the main goals was to bring the carbon footprint of the site down to a sustainable level. This project was coded with html through Visual Studio Code and published on GitHub.
